/**
 * @title PennyPot
 * @notice Buy 1¢ shares of Megapot lottery tickets.
 *
 *         Each Megapot ticket costs $1 (1 USDC). PennyPot fronts every ticket from a
 *         reserve, then sells it as 100 shares at 1¢ each. Share proceeds replenish
 *         the reserve. While a Megapot drawing is open, tickets roll: when the active
 *         ticket fills, anyone can crank `buyTicket` to buy the next, until the
 *         drawing's `drawingTime` (minus a selling-window buffer).
 *
 *         Each share's payout is `ticketWinnings / sharesActuallySold` — so when a
 *         ticket is undersubscribed, every shareholder's slice grows. The pool keeps
 *         zero winnings. Revenue comes from Megapot's referral fees, accrued at an
 *         operator-owned `feeReceiver` address (set in the constructor; PennyPot
 *         lists it as the referrer on every ticket purchase).
 *
 * @dev    Drawing *lifecycle* state is intentionally NOT tracked on-chain — drawings
 *         are indexed off-chain, and Megapot itself is the source of truth for whether
 *         a ticket's drawing has settled (`claimWinnings` reverts otherwise). The
 *         contract is a thin ledger keyed by the Megapot ticket ID:
 *
 *           - buyTicket()                     : front + buy the next Megapot ticket
 *           - buyTicketShares(ticketId, count): buy 1..N shares of the active ticket
 *           - claimWinnings(ticketIds[])      : settle tickets; credit each holder's balance
 *           - withdraw()                      : pull the caller's credited winnings
 *
 *         A drawingId -> ticketIds[] index is kept only as a read convenience
 *         (`getDrawingTicketIds`); it never gates contract logic.
 *
 *         Tightly scoped, non-upgradeable. Pause + reserve withdrawal are the only
 *         owner knobs. See README for the full spec and reasoning.
 *
 *         Ownership and pause use OpenZeppelin's Ownable2Step + Pausable.
